    "## About OEE\n",
    "**Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** is the gold standard for measuring manufacturing productivity.\n",
    "Simply put, it identifies the percentage of manufacturing time that is truly productive.\n",
    "\n",
    "An OEE score of 100% means you are manufacturing only good parts, as fast as possible, with no stop time.\n",
    "In OEE terms, that corresponds to:\n",
    "- 100% Quality (only good parts)\n",
    "- 100% Performance (as fast as possible)\n",
    "- 100% Availability (no stop time)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why TrendMiner for OEE?**\n",
    "TrendMiner provides a highly flexible approach to setting up OEE tracking systems, tightly connecting OEE metrics with production data for intuitive, two-way operations. Engineers can efficiently identify and categorize losses by analyzing trend data and leveraging analytics to calculate integral values promptly. Once collected, OEE data becomes a powerful resource for building reporting flows and performing retrospective analyses to highlight major losses and improvement opportunities."

    "## Solution training overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This session is designed for experienced TrendMiner users who want to learn how to **build custom solution packages** on top of TrendMiner. Rather than being a theoretical exercise, this workshop mirrors the approach used by TrendMiner Data Analytics Engineers when implementing real-world solutions for customers. Although the outcome is a working OEE reporting solution, the real value is learning a **general solutions approach** that you can reuse for many other applications such as energy reporting, batch validation, and quality monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this training, you will have learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capture production events (batches for batch processes, operating periods for continuous processes) with monitors in TrendHub and display them as context items in a ContextHub view\n",
    "- Load those context items via Python and write loss data to their context fields using the TrendMiner SDK\n",
    "- Capture regular periods (weeks/months) and compute OEE KPIs (availability, productivity, quality, overall OEE) over those periods, using the data of production events captured earlier\n",
    "- Creating actionable user dashboards based on this OEE data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Access to your TrendMiner environment (URL, client credentials, and user credentials)\n",
    "- Python with the TrendMiner SDK installed (wheel or pip package provided by TrendMiner)\n",
    "- TrendMiner admin rights to create Context Types & Context Fields in ContextHub settings\n",
    "- A process (batch or continuous) with tags you can read"

    "\n",
    "For a **batch** process, we want to keep the individual batches events intact even if they fall within two different months. After all, there would otherwise not be a way to check whether those batches are taking too much time. We therefore only include the conditions that our batch process is active. We can deal with the problem of batches falling within two different months during the KPI calculation.\n",
